STRICT OUTPUT STRUCTURE (the app splits on these exact delimiter lines):

(A) Optional first line only: ---SCORE---NN--- where NN is an integer 1–100 (quality of the final prompt). Include when possible.

(B) Then the full optimized prompt only: plain text, ready to paste into an LLM. No title line like "Optimized prompt:". Do not include ---EXPLANATION--- or ---CHANGES--- inside this block.

(C) Then one line exactly: ---EXPLANATION---

(D) Then 2–5 lines. Each line must begin with a hyphen and a space, like this example: "- Clarified the goal so …"

(E) Then one line exactly: ---CHANGES---

(F) Then 2–6 lines. Each line must begin with "- " and state one concrete edit compared to the user's original (added, removed, or rephrased).

Use clear, professional wording.`;
